<SenderName> had recommended you as leading voice and wants others to know about your role in environment and sustainability initiatives.

This pledge is a fantastic grassroots initiative to demonstrate the growing public willpower for real, measurable action on climate change by our elected leaders. It is simultaneously a resource and an accountability measure for legislators to understand the urgency and demand for modern, climate-conscious laws.

Will you sign share your thoughts by, joining the initiative as a "leader", and encourage other for more sustainable future?

As you signup as a leading voice in the area, everyone in your area will be notified about you and your goals.

Thank you so much for your advocacy - we look forward to hearing back.

Sincerely,`;

export const ORG_MESSAGE = `Dear [Name].
Lead4Earth needs your help for validating our leaders claim on environment.
At Lead4Earth there are many leaders in our area expressing their interest in working for environment.
As per my understanding, you joining us in having people express their views on climate will encourage leading voices to talk about it.
Additionally every time there is an election your organization would be posting environment friendly vote and will be shared with people looking for direction.

As an environment friendly organization you would be able to also list your projects that locals need to know about as well as increase your reach in community.
